## Description

Learn to parse structured binary data by reading map vertices. This introduces parsing patterns and data validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Reads VERTICES lump from WAD file
- [ ] Parses x y coordinates as i16 values
- [ ] Stores vertices in a Vec<Vertex>
- [ ] Validates data length is correct
