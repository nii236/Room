## Description

Understand ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes through creating simple game data structures. This is the most important Rust concept.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Creates a simple Player struct
- [ ] Understands ownership rules
- [ ] Can pass data between functions safely
- [ ] Explains the difference between move and borrow

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a simple Player struct with x, y coordinates
2. Learn about ownership rules (move, borrow, clone)
3. Practice passing structs to functions
4. Understand mutable vs immutable references
5. Learn about String vs &str differences
