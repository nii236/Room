# Rust Learning Path Through Doom Port Development

## Overview

This learning path teaches Rust programming through building a simplified Doom port. Each task builds upon previous knowledge, introducing new Rust concepts while creating a working game.

## Learning Philosophy

- **Learn by doing**: Every concept is taught through practical implementation
- **Build confidence**: Start with simple concepts and gradually increase complexity
- **Understand the why**: Each task explains not just how to do something, but why it matters
- **Safe by default**: Learn Rust's safety features naturally through game development

## Key Rust Concepts Covered

### Beginner Level (Tasks 1-10)
- **Variables and functions**: Basic syntax and program structure
- **Ownership system**: The core concept that makes Rust unique and safe
- **Error handling**: Using Result and Option instead of exceptions
- **Structs and methods**: Building custom data types
- **Collections**: Working with Vec and HashMap
- **Pattern matching**: Using match and if let for control flow

### Intermediate Level (Tasks 11-20)
- **Modules**: Organizing code as projects grow
- **External crates**: Using dependencies and FFI
- **Traits**: Rust's way of sharing behavior between types
- **Iterators**: Functional programming with map, filter, collect
- **Binary data**: Reading files and parsing formats
- **Graphics programming**: Working with pixels and drawing

### Advanced Level (Tasks 21-30)
- **Lifetimes**: Managing references and memory safety
- **Concurrency**: Using threads safely
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques and profiling
- **Advanced data structures**: Trees, entity systems
- **Testing**: Writing reliable code
- **Systems programming**: Low-level optimizations

## Why Learn Rust Through Game Development?

1. **Immediate feedback**: You can see your code working visually
2. **Practical applications**: Every concept has a real use case
3. **Performance matters**: Games need to be fast, teaching optimization
4. **Memory safety**: Games can't crash, teaching safe programming
5. **Systems programming**: Learn how computers really work

## Getting Started

1. Start with task-1 to learn basic Rust syntax
2. Complete tasks in order - each builds on the previous
3. Take time to understand each concept before moving on
4. Experiment with the code - try breaking it and fixing it
5. Ask questions and look up documentation when stuck

## Tips for Success

- **Don't rush**: Understanding is more important than speed
- **Practice typing**: Write code by hand, don't copy-paste
- **Break problems down**: If stuck, solve smaller parts first
- **Use the compiler**: Rust's error messages are very helpful
- **Test frequently**: Run your code often to catch errors early

## Resources for Learning

- **Rust Book**: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- **Rust by Example**: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/
- **Rustlings**: Interactive exercises to practice Rust
- **Doom Wiki**: https://doomwiki.org/ for game format information

## What You'll Build

By the end of this learning path, you'll have:
- A working mini-Doom engine that can load WAD files
- Understanding of 3D graphics concepts
- Solid foundation in Rust programming
- Experience with systems programming
- A portfolio project to show employers

## Next Steps After Completion

- Add more Doom features (monsters, weapons, sound)
- Learn about advanced graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan)
- Explore other game engines (Bevy, Amethyst)
- Try other systems programming projects
- Contribute to open source Rust projects
